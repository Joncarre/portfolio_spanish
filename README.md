## ðŸš€ Portfolio

This portfolio is based on a design created by [Brittany Chiang](https://brittanychiang.com/). I've made some structural and design modifications to the original template while maintaining the essence of her excellent work. Many thanks to Brittany for her amazing contribution to the open-source community!
